# Zomato-Analysis-Using-Python
This project involved two major steps, focusing on data cleaning and transformation, followed by comprehensive visualization for meaningful insights using Python and it's libraries.

***A. Data Cleaning and Transformation:***

1. *Dropping Unnecessary Columns:*
   - Removed irrelevant columns to streamline the dataset.

2. *Dropping Duplicate Values:*
   - Identified and eliminated duplicated entries for accuracy.

3. *Cleaning Ambiguities:*
   - Addressed any inconsistencies or ambiguities present in the dataset.

4. *Handling Null Values:*
   - Identified null values and replaced them with mean values for completeness.

5. *Dropping Unnecessary Null Values:*
   - Removed rows with unnecessary null values to maintain data integrity.

6. *Renaming Column Names:*
   - Improved readability by renaming columns for better understanding.

7. *Clustering Low-Frequency Values:*
   - Grouped values with low frequency into an "others" category for simplicity.


***B. Visualization by Parameters:***

1. *Number of Restaurants by Location:*
   - Visualized the distribution of restaurants across different locations.

2. *Online Order Service:*
   - Explored the prevalence of online order services among restaurants.

3. *Booking Table Facility:*

   - Mapped the distribution of online order services across locations.

7. *Booking Table Facility Location-wise:*
   - Examined the geographical distribution of restaurants with booking table services.

8. *Types of Restaurants with Ratings:*
   - Explored the relationship between restaurant types and their ratings.

9. *Types of Restaurants Location-wise:*
   - Visualized the distribution of restaurant types across different locations.

10. *Number of Votes Location-wise:*
    - Examined the correlation between the number of votes and restaurant locations.
